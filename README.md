This project is an effort to utilize React web development to tell stories of the natural world that will be generated by AI. Thus providing a voice to nonhumans. Furthermore, the stories told will be created with the help of historical data to produce fictional stories. The goal is to reach a wide audience especially school aged children who can freely use this platform for educational purposes.
